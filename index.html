                            <p style = "text-align: justify" class="fs-5 mb-4">This page is an effort to help students mend their SOP's and put their best foot forward on their journey towards graduate school. One of the most important aspects to get into a good grad school is to write a SOP that summarizes you journey and passion towards the degree you wish to pursue.</p>

                            <p style = "text-align: justify" class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            There are hundereds of blogs and posts on how to write a good SOP which would suffice to give you a good enough generic idea towards getting started. However, the aim of this effort is not to give you a magic formula towards writing an SOP which will get you to all the grad school of your dream.</p>

                            <p style = "text-align: justify" class="fs-5 mb-4">SOP's are highly subjective and its content will be decided by many factors. However, after reviewing a diverse set of SOP's, one realises that there are certain mistakes (both structural and content-wise) which are almost common in all the SOP's. In the first of many phases in this effort, we will try to list and elaborate on those common mistakes and how to avoid them.</p>

                            <p style = "text-align: justify" class="fs-5 mb-4">It is easy to assume that these mistakes are trivial and that even with them, you might get into the school of your dreams. However, making these mends in your SOP might have a huge impact on how you tell your story. Of the thousands of applicants applying for the same seat, the goal of this blog is to make it easy for the admission committee to read through your SOP and understand your journey with ease. </p>

                            <p style = "text-align: justify" class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            If you make it easy for them, they might just make it easy for you to get into that school as well.</p>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">I have odd cosmic thoughts every day</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For me, the most fascinating interface is Twitter. I have odd cosmic thoughts every day and I realized I could hold them to myself or share them with people who might be interested.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect. I kind of want to know what happened there because we're twirling knobs here on Earth without knowing the consequences of it. Mars once had running water. It's bone dry today. Something bad happened there as well.</p>
